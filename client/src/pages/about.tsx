							What We Strive For
						</h2>
						<p className={'text-md'}>
							We strive to create a healthcare ecosystem where technology enhances rather than replaces the human
							connection between patients and providers. Our goal is to make healthcare more accessible, efficient, and
							personalized while maintaining the highest standards of medical care and data privacy. We're committed to
							continuous innovation, ensuring our platform evolves to meet the changing needs of both patients and
							healthcare professionals.

							Why We Started
						</h2>
						<p className={'text-md'}>
							QuantumCare was born from a simple observation: too many people were delaying or foregoing medical care
							due to accessibility challenges. Our founders, a team of healthcare professionals and technology experts,
							witnessed firsthand the gaps in traditional healthcare delivery. They envisioned a future where technology
							could bridge these gaps, making quality healthcare available to everyone. What began as a solution to
							address healthcare disparities has evolved into a comprehensive telehealth platform that's transforming
							how people experience healthcare.
