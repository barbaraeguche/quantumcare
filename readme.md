# quantumcare ü©∫
a comprehensive healthcare management platform designed to manage patient appointments and doctor schedules. the system
features appointment scheduling, secure authentication, prescription management, and role-based access for patients, 
doctors, administrators, and cron scheduling.

## tech stack ‚ú®
- **frontend:** built with vite + react, tailwindcss, and redux for state management.
- **backend:** powered by spring boot and postgresql for database management.
- **deployment:** frontend hosted on vercel; backend deployed on render.

## features üëæ
- **appointment booking system:** schedule and manage healthcare appointments with preferred doctors.
- **secure authentication and access control:** spring security with jwt-based roles, full authorization flow, and complete user account lifecycle.
- **centralized state management:** redux implementation for consistent application state.
- **appointment tracking:** detailed history of past and upcoming medical visits.
- **automated scheduling:** system triggers to free up appointments when doctor availability changes and mark past appointments as completed.
- **prescription management:** medication system with follow-up logic (50% chance for regular appointments, 100% for emergency cases).

## challenges faced üí¢
- **complex form validation:** implementing zod validation for optional numerical inputs in appointment forms.
- **reusable component architecture:** creating the `EditableForm` components to prevent repetitive state management.
- **security configuration:** establishing proper spring security setup with jwt authentication.
- **environment configuration:** integrating `.env` file into `.yml` file with spring boot.
- **multi-role data access:** implementing appropriate permissions for admin, patient, and doctor roles.

## what I learned üí≠
- **advanced form handling:** implementing react hook forms with comprehensive validation.
- **data table implementation:** integrating tanstack table with shadcn.
- **efficient data loading:** creating pagination systems for handling large datasets.
- **date handling techniques:** properly using `parseIso` from date-fns to avoid timezone issues.
- **global state architecture:** implementing redux for application-wide state management.
- **role-based authorization:** managing different user types with appropriate access controls.
- **api security implementation:** configuring spring boot security for protected endpoints.

## limitations üö®
- **static medication database:** medications are pre-defined rather than dynamically sourced.
- **limited authentication options:** no support for third-party providers like github or google.
- **basic analytics capabilities:** minimal reporting tools for administrative oversight.
- **notification system constraints:** lack of real-time alerts for appointments and updates.
- **isolated ecosystem:** no integration with external healthcare information systems.

## improvements üå±
- **ai-powered recommendations:** develop intelligent medication suggestions based on patient profiles.
- **communication platform:** add real-time messaging between patients and medical staff.
- **mobile application support:** create native mobile experiences for ios and android.
- **telehealth integration:** implement video consultation capabilities for remote appointments.
- **expanded analytics dashboard:** develop comprehensive reporting tools for administrators.
- **health record integration:** connect with external electronic health record systems.
- **appointment optimization:** implement intelligent scheduling based on doctor availability patterns.

## .env file & application.properties üìÑ
this project requires `.env` files for both the server and client, located in their respective folders. rename the 
`.env.example` (or `.env.properties.example`) file in each folder by removing the `.example` suffix, and update it with 
the necessary values. ensure these files are configured properly and not committed to version control.
